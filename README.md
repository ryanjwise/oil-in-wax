# Oil in Wax

A 2 sided marketplace for candle makers and candle lovers alike

## R7 Identification of the problem you are trying to solve by building this particular marketplace app.


Covid-19 Lockdowns saw a boom in new hobbies and DIY activities. One of such popular activities was candle making. A relatively simple and cheap activity that produces a tangible product.

The problem is that once people have made these candles, they need to be able to dispose of them thoughtfully, beyond giving them to friends and family, this often meant the sale of their product.

Currently, the best advice out there(and there's lots of it!) for budding candlemakers is to sell them on a platform like Facebook marketplace or create their own online store.

Oil in Wax aims to provide an easy to use, professional and niche marketplace for candlemakers to utilise.

## R8 Why is it a problem that needs solving?

For the consumer the problem with sourcing high-quality candles is twofold. To buy a candle from a mass production supplier there is some degree of risk, as it can be difficult to know if potentially toxic ingredients have been included in their recipes.

Ideally, the solution is to buy from a local, small business that can answer questions about what's in the candle, or even create them to meet your specific scent and aroma needs!

The issue with marketplaces like Facebook is that it is both difficult to find exactly what you're looking for, and it's not a designed for purpose marketplace. Likewise, candle sellers have a similar problem when launching their stores and trying to find an audience.

This is where Oil in Wax comes in, it can provide an easy to use platform for sellers, whilst providing ways for consumers to find candle makers they love, and the information they need to make an informed purchase!
